	<h3><p>Many people ask us what exactly sports event management is. Well hopefully we will be able to explain what it means in general and what it means to us at Gr8events.</p>
	<p>The general definition of Event management, according to Wikipedia, is the application of project management to the creation and development of festivals, sporting events and conferences.</p>
	<p>Event management involves studying the intricacies of the brand, identifying the target audience, devising the event concept, planning the logistics and coordinating the technical aspects before actually launching the event. Post-event analysis and ensuring a return on investment have become significant drivers for the event industry.
	The event management team are the people who plan and execute the event. </p>
	<p>Event managers and their teams are often behind-the-scenes running the event. Event managers may also be involved in more than just the planning and execution of the event, but also brand building, marketing and communication strategy. The event manager is an expert at the creative, technical and logistical elements that help an event succeed. This includes event design, audio-visual production, scriptwriting, logistics, budgeting, negotiation and, of course, client service. It is a multi-dimensional profession.</p>
	<p>We at Gr8events are experts in providing sporting event management for external organisations who may have the drive and idea of an event but lack the expertise to develop it into a success.</p>
	<p>Great events can manage all aspects of your event from course design, traffic management, marketing, risk assessment, data capture, event budget, event build up and take down, on the day management, volunteer management and equipment supplier.
